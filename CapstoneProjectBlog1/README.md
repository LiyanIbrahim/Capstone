For this week, I mainly worked on fixing/finalizing the journal part of the website, I changed some stuff including some graphics and colors mainly. 
I also sent it out for user testing.

I also am working on drafting the tweets for my twitter version. I’m contemplating actually making different twitter accounts vs making a “fake” interface. But I’ve identified the tweets and what category they fall under. These are the categories im considering: 
</br>
idea of memory in the age of technology,  performative aspect of twitter, communities are formed differently online, appropriation of media 
</br>
I plan on including them in the form of tweets as well as threads, usernames, images 

Some order I'm considering: 

Order: </br>
<li>
  <ul>What is on my heart is on my twitter </ul>
  <ul>Tweet about how social media makes home accessible </ul>
  <ul>Thread: </ul>
appropriation of media 
  <ul>Performative aspect of twitter (1)</ul>
  <ul>communities are formed differently online</ul>
  <ul>Liked tweet </ul>
  <ul>Retweet tweet </ul>
  <ul>Performative aspect of twitter (2)</ul>
