For this week, along with my drafts for my bio and artist statement, I worked on prototyping what my website could potentially look like. I know I want different characters and different storylines based on that and so this is the direction I took. I also did some very basic user testing. 
My general plan with this is: </br>

Visual animation of something related to the project (not interactive) → what I have now → story </br>

What I did so far is animate the title, it leaves the screen but it comes back and is a clickable link that will take you to an about page (I still did not fill that up so it is a blank page so far), when you hover over the page, some text will appear depending on where the user hovers. Initially it was in a different format but after having a couple of my friends test it, they said that the text was hard to find. So I increased the font size, added more text and changed the positions. I am also looking into more ways to make this more intuitive. 

Things I can do with the text effect: 
<ul>
  <li>User need to find the start button</li> 
  <li>Form a sentence to continue → based on the sentence formed they are assigned characters </li>
  <li>Based on what the press they are assigned a role → other roles are automated </li>
  </ul>

I am leaning towards the third point because at this point it feels more intuitive but this will also heavily depend on the story. </br>
