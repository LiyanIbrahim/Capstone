For this week, along with my drafts for my bio and artist statement, I worked on prototyping what my website could potentially look like. I know I want different characters and different storylines based on that and so this is the direction I took. I also did some very basic user testing. 
My general plan with this is: </br>

Visual animation of something related to the project (not interactive) → what I have now → story </br>

What I did so far is animate the title, it leaves the screen but it comes back and is a clickable link that will take you to an about page (I still did not fill that up so it is a blank page so far), when you hover over the page, some text will appear depending on where the user hovers. Initially it was in a different format but after having a couple of my friends test it, they said that the text was hard to find. So I increased the font size, added more text and changed the positions. I am also looking into more ways to make this more intuitive.
