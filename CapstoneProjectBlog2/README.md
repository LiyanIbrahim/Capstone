This week I focused mainly on (1) writing and developing the twitter page and users and (2) getting solicited feedback on the journal part.</br>

(1) I faced a couple issues here. I had the tweets planned out along with what usernames would be tweeting them and how they’re interacting. The first issue I ran into is the fact that I couldn't make too many emails under the same phone number and so this restricted and redesigned the interactions. I don’t necessarily hate or like them more but I will wait for some feedback from the people experiencing it. 
The second issue I had was embedding my account on the website. I tried to use the same method  as embedding any regular website which just uses the link but it didn't work and told me that twitter cuts off the connection. After doing research on that, the only way I found would work is embed the separate tweets and I’m now trying to figure out if this is what I like and want or if I should figure out a different way to do that.</br>

</br>(2)I met with 2 professor to get feedback on my journal and this is what I have so far </br>
<ul> 
  <li> Enjoyed/encouraged to keep the simplistic version/designs </li> 
  <li>Enjoyed/encouraged to keep the simplistic version/designs  </li>
<li> A time machine: it took both professors to a certain time period in the web and in their life </li>
<li> Prof Joerg caught my attention to the fact that, at least to him, it’s a gendered experience. I asked Prof. Micheal Allison if he felt that way. He said that while he did not actively think about it, that once I mentioned it, it is a gendered experience but he said that it didn’t matter to him </li> 
<li> Blogging/internet journal. I think these interviews brought to my attention that I unintentionally ended up designing a internet journal instead of a real journal as I intended </li> 
  <li> The poetic nature of the writing. I actually had mixed feedback on this </li>
  </ul>
