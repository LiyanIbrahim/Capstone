For this week, I continued refining the twitter part of my project. A main point I wanted to tackle this week was developing ambiguous identities for my twitter accounts. I have three accounts </br>
<ul> 
  <li> MyvirtualLife (my main account) </li>
  <li> Theyotherizeustocolonize (more of a witty/snarky) </li> 
  <li> Weuse”our”weareally (orientalist) </li>
</ul> 

I’m having a bit of trouble making these identities ambiguous but still different and have some sort of different personality features. A reason this might be happening is because I want to keep identifying factors such as gender, age hidden. 
Writing the bios and usernames was fine but finding images that people would normally have on. 

Some of my notes: </br>
Theyotherize us to colonize  → witty </br>
So you want to hear a couple of general and useless tweets?</br>

Weuser”our” we are allys → white man equivalent</br>
→ all look similiar → ambiguous </br>
