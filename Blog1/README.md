For my first capstone prototype, I wanted to filter out the main objectives of what I want my storytelling project to encompass. I want this project to focus on user/audience planning and social/contextual awareness. </br>
Therefore, I researched multiple digital storytelling/immersive theatre pieces and I wrote down some objectives behind these kinds of work that I would want to strongly incorporate in my project.
