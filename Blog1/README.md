For my first capstone prototype, I wanted to filter out the main objectives of what I want my storytelling project to encompass. I want this project to focus on user/audience planning and social/contextual awareness. </br>
Therefore, I researched multiple digital storytelling/immersive theatre pieces and I wrote down some objectives behind these kinds of work that I would want to strongly incorporate in my project.

Particularly, I want to focus on first two points of: </br>
Challenging the notions of how we understand new emerging technology and celebrating great/historical literary work or stories are massive motivators for my idea. 


<h3> Role of the user: </h3>
User interaction is a huge contributor to my project as I want it to be immersive and so my prototype also includes different ways the user can interact in the story. 
These may include: 
<ul>
  <li>Users being decision-makers</li>
  <li>Interview process of some sort </li>
  <li>Users interact with the project but also interact with each other</li>
  <li>Users go through a test and this determines what group the user is placed into</li>
  </ul>
I tried to encapsulate what the skeleton of this project might look like through this experience.

<h3>Potential message:</h3> 
While I initially wanted this project to explore the idea of technology for social good /algorithmic biases, I decided to actually shift away from that and explore a rather non-tech topic digitally. Therefore, I want to use digital tools to elevate the art of storytelling (or look into ways that I can use digital tools to tell a story). One topic that predominates my social/contextual awareness is my non solidified identity of being a descendant of refugees. While I really do not want this to be explicit, these are some ways being a Palestinian raised on the internet could be entry points to my story.
