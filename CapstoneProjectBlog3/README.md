This week was spent mainly on fixing the twitter page I had done last week. I didn't get as much as I wanted done but I got the screenshots and implemented them on the webpage. I also added images to the user so it is more visually stimulating. I also decided to go with the screenshots instead of embedded tweets but I made some screenshots clickable and that opens the tweet on twitter itself. I think this also further adds to the idea of being able to engage with the tweets vs not.
While it is very linear right now and it kinda looks like a version of twitter, Iâ€™m looking at ways I can make it different from that. For example, maybe instead of scrollable for it to be displayed differently.
