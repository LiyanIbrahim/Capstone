This week was a bit chaotic in terms of ideations and finding a single idea or direction to isolate and work on. I was focusing primarily on figuring out a message and/or a story to work on but I ended up doing multiple things, many of which were influenced and readjusted/thought through after my meeting with Heather (my advisor).

  <li> <b>Message/Story evolvement:</b> At this point, I would like my story to, generally, be centered around the idea of identity formation, growing up on the internet and navigating borders and barriers in this new ‘reality’. Some subtopics that I could also include are: internet pollution, how similar it can feel growing up on the internet vs not (not always a critique of how the internet impacts identity but just a comment on the role of technology in shaping how we view the world and how we tell stories, anonymity system of the online communities impact. </li>
