For people who study this: </br>
<ul>
  <li>Can the term postcolonial be explored through a single narrative </li>
<li>“Complexities of a postcolonial subject”, is this site specific/can it be explored universally? Arab-American vs Gulf vs Arab-African roots </li>
  <li>How does technology influence others' views on postcolonial subjects?</li>
  <li>How does technology influence one's views on themselves </li>
  <li>When does “post-colonial” begin? </li>
  <li>How is the internet experience different for people in different areas of the world? </li>
</ul>
For people who experienced this: </br>
<ul>
<li>Their generation vs older generations vs younger generations (generational divide?) </li>
<li>How technology influences their identity? (hard question) → too general (make it more specific) </li>
<li>Do you feel like technology gives you a platform for greater reach across people? </li>
<li>Do you feel like technology gives you a platform for connecting with people with similar experience? (dynamic of feeling connected vs isolated) </li> 
<li>How is your experience with the internet affected by your location? → could be asked differently/drawn from asking about personal experiences? (always yes) (people know that the internet is censored) (experience with censorship vs liberation) </li>
</ul>
