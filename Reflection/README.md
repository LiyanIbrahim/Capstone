Through the semester so far, I’ve developed my idea extensively and started working on prototyping and thinking through the execution of how my project will look like. </br>
My idea went from wanting to explore digital identities and identity formation on the internet to a more specific one exploring that narrative through the lens of being a post-colonial subject. </br>

I initially wanted to create a ‘choose your own adventure game’ because I thought it would be cool and thought-provoking but also because multiple people in the breakout rooms where we had to present our initial ideas mentioned how cool that would be. I was also speaking to a friend who has experience creating and facilitating this kind of work and she said that we don't see much of this kind of execution so it would be interesting to pursue. However, after prototyping my idea more and thinking through and talking to my mentor about what I want this project to be like, I don’t think I will be taking that exact approach but I am thinking and prototyping ways to still keep my project equally as immersive and interactive. 
Even though I kind of prototyped something technical every week/thought of ways of execution every week, when I was looking back at them, I was mostly drawn to the first ever prototype I made which I will discuss later on. </br>
The idea of exploring post-colonial subjects was extensively discussed in my midterm but I essentially want to use personal experiences and external work (literature, art, films) from that field to write narratives in (a) digital culture from a post colonial perspective and (b) reimaging a future of belonging. (a) mainly draws on my original idea that explores the concept of identity formation on the internet and the concept of being connected globally and disconnected locally. (b) mainly explores what we think the internet might be like if we belonged (or reimaging a future of belonging). 
I want to explore these narratives through objects and memories. The idea of how we’re defined by our memories and how these memories are navigated in different mediums interests me and I would want to explore it in this project through objects. The user would have to explore and form a perception of the character in my narrative through the objects that lead to memories and memory rooms. I would want to explore that through generations. </br>

Some notes from class/how they are affecting my project and thought process/things I’ve made:
<ol>
  <li>Execution: As I mentioned, initially, I had a lot of positive feedback on creating a “choose your own adventure” type scenario. I decided to do, what I think will be an equally immersive/interactive path of exploring objects through memories and rooms as shown:</li>

<li>One feedback I got is to consider having people start at different points since people inherently have different starting points in life. While I do think this is a good idea and I definitely want to consider it, I think I want to implement that differently since I don’t think I can boil down and quantify someone’s oppression. What I don’t want to create is an illusion of comparing oppressions (oppression Olympics). Therefore, I need to find a way to incorporate and recognize that in a way that is not generalizing or simplify any type of struggle. </li> 
<li> Following that, the first prototype I made discussed how I wanted to split people into different groups and characters and I might explore something similar maybe in terms of rooms just to add an extra element of interactivity and personalization. I’m not sure yet if I want the placements to be random but I think I will follow a similar way as I prototyped earlier this semester. </li> 
<li>In one of my prototypes, I looked at ways an interactive story can be portrayed visually. I was mainly exploring both text-based interactions as well as visuals. This was very useful for me because it felt like I had to pick one which is why I looked into both. However, I’m considering rooms as shown above and I think it would be very stimulating visually if one of the objects was a notebook and you had to go through written memories through text-based interactions amid more visual work. </li> 
<li>This is definitely a subtopic but one feedback I got was particularly striking to me and that was “using an invention made by colonizers to liberate ourselves”. I think I want to expand and explore this in (b) reimaging a future of belonging and how this statement affects the way we view the internet and the way we imagine ourselves in relation to that. </li>
<li>Another prototype I made is purely aesthetic and I do plan on using it and that is using a javascript library to convert an image to ASCII code. I think I want to use that in some rooms ironically because I think technology is very integrated into our world yet the way this js library works feels very dystopian which adds an extra dimension to my project. </li>
