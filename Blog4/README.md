Because I want animations and I’m using a website to host my project, I started learning how to use this javascript library, three.js, that would allow me to do 3D animations. I learned the basics of using it but I also found an ASCII art generator within the p5.js library extension and so I used that to generate different ASCII pictures that could be used in my capstone project in parallel to the original pictures. I wanted to see how it would look if, for any reason, the user had to navigate/glitch between the ascii and the regular. 

Potential images I wanted to try out (slightly different variations): 
<ol>
  <li>Scenery variation [1](https://github.com/LiyanIbrahim/Capstone/blob/main/Blog4/scene1.png) </li>
  <li>Scenery (variation 2) </li>
  The text took more time and I still don't like the way they turned out
  <li>Text 1 </li>
   <li>Text 2 </li>
   <li>Text 3 </li>
  <li>[Webcam](https://github.com/LiyanIbrahim/Capstone/blob/main/Blog4/webcamASCII.png) </li>
  </ol>
I also found part an online generator where I can customize the ascii code produced which I will continue to experiment on. </br>

Idea development:  </br>
I want my project to be a pick your adventure kind of game, similar to the bandersnatch episode from black mirror. I’m still developing the idea/message that I want to be the core of the project but I can already imagine it not being my own story but drawn from experience and emotions I heavily relate to. I want the decisions to be difficult and thought provoking and so I’m looking into introducing a risk factor or something that would make the decision making process more consequential. 
</br>
Here’s a rough draft of some ways I could go about this:
