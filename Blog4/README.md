Because I want animations and Iâ€™m using a website to host my project, I started learning how to use this javascript library, three.js, that would allow me to do 3D animations. I learned the basics of using it but I also found an ASCI art generator within the p5.js library extension and so I used that to generate different ASCI pictures that could be used in my capstone project in parallel to the original pictures. I wanted to see how it would look if, for any reason, the user had to navigate/glitch between the ascii and the regular. 

Potential images I wanted to try out: 
<ol>
  <li>Scenery </li>
  <li>Humans/characters </li>
  <li>Text </li>
  <li>Web cam (?) </li>
  </ol>
